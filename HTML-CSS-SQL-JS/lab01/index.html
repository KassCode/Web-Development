        <h2>A little info about yours truly...</h2>
        <p>The contents of this website will cover general information about myself, my interests, and those I hold dear.
            I am a lady in her late 20s living in North Dakota with a dog and two cats. I work full-time and take about 9
            credits a semester towards a Cyber Operations degree. In my free time I watch movies, play games, and take some
            time to enjoy nature. The overall purpose of this website is to display HTML and CSS knowledge throughout the
            Fall 2017 semester for CIS 275.

        <h3>Prior HTML/CSS Experience</h3>
        <p>In addition to working to maintain high marks in this course, I look most forward to learning more in depth about
        HTML and CSS. I had dabbled over the past several years in helping others build webpages after having played with the
        language a bit growing up. What initially got my interest was early social media and web journals often offered the
        ability to change the format of your page with HTML and CSS. Once facebook became the <strong>almighty</strong> social media platform,
        HTML and CSS were no longer an option and thus, from then on only dipped my fingers in the language.</p>
